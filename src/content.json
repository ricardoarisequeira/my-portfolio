      "Hi there! üëã I'm Ricardo Sequeira, a passionate software engineer with a solid foundation in computer science. I studied at one of the top engineering universities in Lisbon, Portugal, where I earned my master's degree üéì. After completing my studies, I spent several years in the industry, gaining valuable experience working on a range of projects.",
      "Beyond coding, I believe in the power of learning by doing. I love exploring new challenges not only in programming but also in other creative endeavors. From gardening üå± and making sourdough bread üçû to woodworking ü™ö and cooking üç≥, I find joy in balancing the mental work of coding with hands-on, tactile creativity. I also have a deep love for the outdoors and hiking, which allows me to connect with nature and recharge my spirit.",
      "Traveling and experiencing new cultures are also big parts of my life üåç. In 2024, I took a sabbatical year, which took me through Europe, Iceland, Canada, and the USA. During this time, I worked in various seasonal jobs that not only made the journey financially possible but also helped me develop valuable soft skills, such as communication, adaptability, and resilience.",
      "What drives me in software development is the constant challenge it presents. It's an industry where continuous learning is key to staying up-to-date and evolving with new technologies üíª. I also enjoy building strong relationships with clients, listening to their feedback, and working together to create solutions that truly meet their needs. This client-focused approach is one of the most rewarding aspects of my work.",
      "Currently, I'm looking to take the next step in my career by seeking international experience. My girlfriend and I are planning to relocate to the Netherlands for new opportunities and adventures üá≥üá±. I'm excited to immerse myself in a new environment, grow professionally, and contribute to innovative projects in the global tech community."
